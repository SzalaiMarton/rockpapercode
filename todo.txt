probability strat change:
	-whilst collecting info about enemy it tweaks the probabilitychange's value
	-instead of a general change value every play has it's own ?

new strat:
	-recognition:
		-try to recognize a pattern based on the enemy's previous plays
		-the strategy it self is done, still there is room for improvement
			-in decide to play the play pick isn't really advanced: just iterate through patterns and if the previous play was found play the patterns next element
